# Introduction

An array is a basic data structure to store a collection of elements sequentially.

Elements can be accessed randomly since each element in the array can be identified by an array index.

An array can have one or more dimensions.

Like one-dimensional array, which is also called the linear array.

And two-dimensional array. Similar to a one-dimensional array, a two-dimensional array also consists of a sequence of elements. But the elements can be laid out in a rectangular grid rather than a line.
