# Linked List

Similar to the array, the linked list is also a linear data structure.

As you can see, each element in the linked list is actually a separate object while all the objects are linked together by the reference field in each element.

There are two types of linked list: singly linked list and doubly linked list.

## Singly Linked List

Each node in a singly-linked list contains not only the value but also a reference field to link to the next node.
By this way, the singly-linked list organizes all the nodes in a sequence.
